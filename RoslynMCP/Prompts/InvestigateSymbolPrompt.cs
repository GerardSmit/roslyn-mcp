            I need to understand the symbol `{{symbolName}}` in the project containing `{{filePath}}`.

            Please investigate it step by step:

            1. **Find the symbol** — Call `FindSymbol` with `filePath={{filePath}}` and `symbolName={{symbolName}}` to locate declarations matching this name.

            2. **Go to definition** — For each match found (especially if there is a primary/most relevant one), call `GoToDefinition` with an appropriate markup snippet to see its source code and context.

            3. **Find usages** — Call `FindUsages` with a markup snippet targeting the symbol to discover all references across the project.

            4. **Check structure** — Call `GetFileOutline` on the file containing the definition to show how the symbol fits within its surrounding type and namespace.

            5. **Summarize** — Provide a concise overview:
               - What the symbol is (type, method, property, etc.) and its purpose
               - Where it is defined and its accessibility
               - How many references it has and the key call sites
               - Any notable patterns (e.g., only used in tests, called from a single entry point, part of a public API)
